# How Linux Routes Packets

This post covers the technical details of packet routing in Linux. Linux
has mechanisms in place to route packets using basic, "destination" based routing,
and advanced or policy-based routing. 


# Background


## Routing Tables

Linux is capable of having multiple routing tables. Each table has one or more
rules associated with it. A user can define up to 252 unique routing tables. The tables
can be defined either using a string or a number, but those are mapped to an integer.
There are also four predefined routing tables, 

1. `CAMPAT`
2. `DEFAULT`
3. `MAIN`
4. `LOCAL`

### COMPAT

This routing table is for background compatibility with older versions of Linux (XXX - I am making this up and need to verify that it is true)

### DEFAULT

The `DEFAULT` routing table is used when no other tables are applicable for a packet.

### MAIN

The `MAIN` routing tables is used for XXX.

### LOCAL

The `LOCAL` routing table is used for packets generated and received by the local processes.

```c

/* Reserved table identifiers */

enum rt_class_t {
	RT_TABLE_UNSPEC=0,
/* User defined values */
	RT_TABLE_COMPAT=252,
	RT_TABLE_DEFAULT=253,
	RT_TABLE_MAIN=254,
	RT_TABLE_LOCAL=255,
	RT_TABLE_MAX=0xFFFFFFFF
};

```

# Lifetime of a packet

There are three primary situations in which the routing code is invoked, when
the Linux machine is a Server, a Client, and a Router. The following
subsections will take us through the lifetime of a packet as it traverses the
Linux kernel.

## Server: Remote to Local

When a user writes a server program, like OpenVPN, WireGuard, IPsec, or
ShadowSocks, one of the primary functions invoked in user-space are the
`listen` and `accept` system calls. The following code segments are examples
of running each of these programs as servers. was taken from OpenVPN.

```c

// TODO: Add snippet of code from OpenVPN server.

```

```c

// TODO: Add snippet of code from WireGuard server.

```
Figure WireGuard
```c

// TODO: Add snippet of code from IPsec server.

```
Figure IPsec
```c

// TODO: Add snippet of code from ShadowSocks server.

```

## Client: Local to Remote 

## Router: Remote to Remote
