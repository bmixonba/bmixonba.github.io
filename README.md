### Attacking Connection Tracking Frameworks as used by Virtual Private Networks

I was the lead researcher that discovered a vulnerability in connection tracking frameworks, such as, Netfilter, IPFILTER, and IPFW.
We used this  vulnerability to build an exploit primitive called the `Port Shadow`. Using the Port Shadow, we implemented four 
attacks against popular VPN protocols such as OpenVPN, WireGuard, and OpenConnect. The attacks can be used for a range
of things, such as escalating from adjacent to in-path (ATIP), port scanning a VPN client behind the VPN server,
deanonymization a VPN client's connections, or rerouting a VPN client's incoming packets to an attacker.

### TSPU: Russia's decentralized censorship system

I contributed to techniques for measuring the Russian information controls apparatus know as the TSPU.

# Industry

## RiskSense

I was the Innovations Leader at New Mexico startup, RiskSense from 2017-2020. Here, I was responsible for a range of projects
including developing automated penetration testing tools. I also proposed and developed a prototype machine learning pipeline
to ingest OSINT data and generate a score measuing the likelihood a vulnerability would be exploited. I also wrote and was 
an author on a patent for this work.
